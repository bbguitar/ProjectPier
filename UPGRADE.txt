Upgrading ProjectPier 0.8.5.0 BETA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ProjectPier 0.8.5.0 is database compatible with previous versions.

There is not an upgrade script for ProjectPier 0.8.5.0 Beta.  Because this is BETA software, nobody
should be upgrading a production installation of ProjectPier.  Also, since there will be additional
changes to 0.8.5.x before the final release, it does not make sense to create an upgrade patch
for the first BETA release.  Instead, create a new installation of ProjectPier 0.8.5.0 Beta 
to use for testing only.  Upgrade instructions will be provided with the final release of 0.8.5.x.
